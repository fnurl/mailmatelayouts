A few layouts for [MailMate](https://freron.com/).

## Usage

The layouts come in two version, widescreen and vertical. I use the vertical layouts when MailMate is on a display that I have rotated.

Copy the `.plist` files to `~/Library/Application Support/MailMate/Resources/Layouts`. 

The following layouts are available and can be activated by going the menu `View > Layout`:

- Widescreen layout with Thread and Correspondence panels
- Widescreen layout with Thread and Tag panels
- Vertical layout with Thread and Correspondence panels
- Vertical layout with Thread and Tag panels.

## Details

All four layouts add a "*Thread panel*" and either a *Correspondence panel* or at *Tag panel*. The selected message in the *Correspondence panel* is shown in the *Message Viewer* panel.

The *Thread panel* shows all messages that belong to the same thread as the selected message in the *Correspondance panel*.

The *Correspondence panel* contains messages where both the sender and the recipient(s) of the message are participating in (either as sender/recipent, or both as recipients).

The *Tag panel* displays messages that have been tagged with the same tag (any tag) as the message in the main outline.
